    "text": "Safety - Effectiveness of safety management (EoSM)\nSafety is monitored through the effectiveness of safety management (EoSM) of the ANSPs KPI. The EoSM KPI measures the level of implementation of the following safety management objectives (MOs):\n\nSafety policy and objectives;\nSafety risk management;\nSafety assurance;\nSafety promotion; and\nSafety culture.\n\nThe EoSM for ANSPs is a set of questions to determine the minimum level of maturity for each management objective. The answers are provided by the ANSPs and verified by the NSAs. The questions are developed by EASA and included in the supporting technical material to the Regulation. For each objective, the maturity level achieved is determined by the lowest maturity level of any question allocated to a management objective. When answering the questions, one of the following maturity levels of implementation should be selected:\n\nLevel A which is defined as ‘Informal Arrangements’ — SMS processes and/or requirements have not been agreed at the organisation level; they are either not routinely undertaken or depend on the individual assigned to the task.\nLevel B which is defined as ‘Defined’ — SMS processes and/or requirements are defined but not yet fully implemented, documented or consistently applied.\nLevel C which is defined as ‘Managed’ — SMS processes and/or requirements are fully documented and consistently applied.\nLevel D which is defined as ‘Assured’ — Evidence is available to provide confidence that SMS processes and/or requirements are being applied appropriately and are delivering positive, measurable results.\n\nIn addition to the minimum level achieved for a MO, an EoSM score is calculated. Each of the 100 questions in the EoSM questionnaire scores one (1) if the target for the associated MO is achieved or nil (0) if not achieved. The score gives an indication of how many areas (questions) the ANSPs need to improve.\nApplicable EoSM targets are defined at Union-wide level, local level (ANSPs) and for network functions (Network Manager). For RP3, the following target should be achieved by 2024:\n\nAt least Level C in the safety management objectives ‘safety culture’, ‘safety policy and objectives’, ‘safety assurance’, and ‘safety promotion’; and\nAt least Level D in the safety management objective ‘safety risk management’.\n\nIn addition, for the Network Manager the safety PI, defined as the ATFM over-deliveries above the capacity limits of a sector declared by the air navigation service provider where ATFM regulations are imposed, is presented."

    "text": "Environment - Horizontal en route flight efficiency of the actual flight path (KEA)\nEnvironmental performance is measured through the horizontal en route flight efficiency of the actual flight path (KEA) KPI. The KEA KPI measures the additional distance flown beyond the great circle distance. ‘en route’ is defined as the distance flown outside a circle of 40 NM around the airport. The indicator is calculated for the whole calendar year and for each year of the reference period, as an average (excluding the ten highest daily values and the ten lowest daily values).\nThis additional distance flown is impacted by the actions of ANSPs but also the route choices of airspace users, airspace restrictions or network measures. The higher the KEA value, the worse the performance.\nKEA is the only environment KPI upon which Union-wide and local (national or FAB level) performance is assessed. Applicable KEA targets are defined at Union-wide level, while local targets are derived from the national reference values set out in latest version of the European Route Network Improvement Plan (ERNIP) available at the time of adoption of the Union-wide performance targets.\nFor the Network Manager, the environment KPI measures the efficiency of the European route network related to the last filed flight plan trajectory (KEP)."

This indicator covers all IFR flights and all ATFM delay causes, excluding exceptional events and it is calculated for the whole calendar year and for each year of the reference period.\nTotal ATFM delay per flight is broken down across the following delay groups:\n\nCapacity (delay code C);\nStaffing (S); - Disruptions (I, T);\nWeather (D, W); and\nOther non-ATC (A, E, G, M, N, O, P, R, V, NA).\n\nAverage en route ATFM delay per flight is the only capacity KPI upon which Union-wide performance is assessed.

At Union-wide level the cost-efficiency KPI is expressed in terms of year-on-year percentage change against the target. At local level (charging zone), the yearly DUC values, as included in the adopted performance plan, are fixed in advance for the entire reference period and cost-efficiency performance are monitored by comparing the DUC to the actual unit cost (AUC), which is computed as the ratio between actual costs and actual service units.\nAt local level, also the terminal DUC is monitored as KPI.\nApplicable cost-efficiency targets are defined at Union-wide level, while local targets are expressed in terms of consistency of the DUC at charging zone level with the Union-wide DUC trend over the reference period.\nFor the network functions, the cost-efficiency KPI is the actual unit cost for the execution of the Network Manager tasks. The indicator is calculated as the ratio between the actual costs and the service units at the level of the geographical area where the Network Manager executes its tasks."
